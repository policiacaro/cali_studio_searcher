# cali_studio_searcher
A small tool in Javascript that calls the Wikipedia API for a list of game studios in California, and then (lazily, false positives) parses the wikitext to see if the company still exists. I made this for a friend looking for jobs in California.) 

The companies have individual buttons for the API calls in order to prevent rate limiting from Wikipedia due to sending out too many requests at once.
